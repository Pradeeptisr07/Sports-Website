                A glimpse of early life
            </h1>
            <p>
                Kom was born in village called Sagang in Manipur's Churachandpur district . After 5 months of her birth
                they went to Kangathei village, Moirang Lamkhai in Churachandpur district of rural Manipur in India. She
                came from a poor Kom family. Her parents, Mangte Tonpa Kom and Mangte Akham Kom were tenant farmers who
                worked in jhum fields.
                <br>
                Kom grew up in humble surroundings, helping her parents with farm related chores,
                going to school and learning athletics initially and later boxing simultaneously. Kom studied at the
                Loktak Christian Model High School at Moirang up to her sixth standard and thereafter attended St.
                Xavier Catholic School, Moirang, up to class VIII.
                <br>
                During this time, she took a good amount of interest in athletics, especially javelin and 400 metres
                running. It was at this juncture, Dingko Singh, a fellow
                Manipuri returned from the 1998 Bangkok Asian games with a gold medal. Kom recollects that this had
                inspired many youngsters in Manipur to try boxing, and she too thought of giving it a try.
